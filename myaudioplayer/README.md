# React Audio Player Tutorial Code
### What is this repository?
This repository contains the code for my **React Audio Player** video tutorial. Please note that this code is not tested and may contain errors and therefore <span style="color:red">should not be used in a real app</span>. The code is supposed to be used as a helper when coding along the video tutorial.

**<span style="color:red">THIS IS NOT AN AUDIO PLAYER LIBRARY FOR REACT!!!</span>**

If you need an Audio Player in your React Application please look for an Audio Player library for React this project here is only for learning purposes.

### Branches

This repository contains two branches.
The `starter-project` branch contains the empty starter project which has been created with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite). It already contains all the required assets like the songs, cover art images and icons used in the ui. This is the starting point when you want to code along to the video tutorial.

The `main` branch contains the implemented Audio Player and is supposed to be used as a guide when coding along. If something is not working with your code you can compare it to the code in this branch.
